* Activity Heuristics.

This optimization was implemented in accordance to section 4.6 of [1].
The main idea is that if a variable causes conflicts often, it's given
a higher priority once selecting a new unassigned variable in future
assumptions, as this might speed up the resolution of the problem
when using a DPLL solver.

To achieve this effect, an activity rating or score is given to a
variable when it's involved in a conflict. All variableshave an
activity that will continue to increase as they are involved in
conflicts.  A conflict increments the variable's activity by a
specific quantity. This quantity is increased with every new conflict
to give a higher priority to recently conflicted variables.

This activity value assigned to each variables comes into play
when a new assumption is made, as the varaible with the highest
activity is selected over the others for the assignment.


--- Results ---

The improvements are more apparent using the medium problem-set.
With dpll-base, the time of resolution when running in
kilburn.cs.man.ac.uk is of over 4 minutes, while the new solver with
activity heuristics can run the test in a around a minute and a half.
